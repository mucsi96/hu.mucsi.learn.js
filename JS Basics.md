# 5 primitive types #
* number
* string
* boolean
* null
* undefined

others are objects

# Native objects #
* built-in(Array,Date)
* user-defined

# Host objects #
* window
* DOM objects

# Prototypes #
* Every function you create automatically gets a prototype property that points to a new blank object.
* This object is almost identical to an object created with an object literal or Object() constructor, except that its constructor property points to the function you create and not to the built-in Object().

# Functions #
* every function, no matter what syntax you use
to create it, automatically gets a length property containing the number of arguments the function expects
